          I'm a Software engineer and web developer, also go by the name <i>Sum Tsui</i>. I speak Native
          Chinese and fluent English.

          I mainly do full-stack web development with JavaScript. I prefer keyboard over trackpad, trackpad
          over mouse. I prefer commandline over GUI. I am terrible at MicroSoft Office Suits. I hate that
          you can horizontally and vertically swipe on something, which unfortunately, is everywhere now. I
          believe Computer Science is the magic in our world (maybe there is another world where alchemy is
          theirs, who knows).

        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I hate repetitive works. If some work takes one hour to do manually, I would rather write a script
          to do it even if it takes the whole day to get it right (if circumstance allows).
        </p>
        <p>I am always skeptical about the next "new and shiny library/tool".</p>
        <p>
          I prefer understanding the fundamentals before deciding if I should embrace another set of APIs on
          top of what has already been offered. Every developer wants to be the rule maker instead of the
          follower (including me of course). So sometimes we unnecessarily abstract things and create
          learning overheads for other developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          What I love about Computer Science is that it differs from other natural sciences that it is the
          pure product of human decision-makings and collaborations, from using 2 different signals to
          represent 0 and 1, to every subsequent decisons made. All the smart and stupid decisions led us
          where we are now.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think machine is the least human thing ever, but the makings of it is all about human, the
          humors, the compromises, etc, which I like a lot.
