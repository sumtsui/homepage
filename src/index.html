        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          I hate repetitive works. If some work takes one hour to do manually, I
          would rather write a script to do it even if it takes the whole day to
          get it right (if circumstance allows).
        </p>
        <p>
          I prefer using keyboard over trackpad, trackpad over mouse. I like
          using my code editor (VSCode) with only the keyboard.
        </p>
        <p>I prefer commandline over GUI.</p>
        <p>
          I am always skeptical about the next "new and shiny library/tool".
        </p>
        <p>
          I prefer understanding the fundamentals before deciding if I should
          embrace another set of APIs on top of what has already been offered.
          Every developer wants to be the rule maker instead of the follower
          (including me of course). So sometimes we unnecessarily abstract
          things and create learning overheads for other developers.
        </p>
        <p>I hate MicroSoft Office Suits and I am terriable at it.</p>
        <p>
          What I love about Computer Science is that it differs from other
          natural sciences that it is the pure product of human decision-makings
          and collaborations, from using 2 different signals to represent 0 and
          1, to every subsequent decisons made. All the smart and stupid
          decisions led us where we are now.
        </p>
        <p>
          I think machine is the least human thing ever, but the makings of it
          is all about human, the humors, the compromises, etc, which I like a
          lot.
        </p>
        <p>
          I believe Computer Science is the magic in our world (maybe there is
          another world where alchemy is their magic, who knows).
