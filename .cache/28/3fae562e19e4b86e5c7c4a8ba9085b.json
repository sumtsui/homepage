If some work takes one hour to do manually, I\n          would rather write a script to do it even if it takes the whole day to\n          get it right (if circumstance allows).\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          I prefer using keyboard over trackpad, trackpad over mouse. I like\n          using my code editor (VSCode) with only the keyboard.\n        </p>\n        <p>I prefer commandline over GUI.</p>\n        <p>\n          I am always skeptical about the next \"new and shiny library/tool\".\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          I prefer understanding the fundamentals before deciding if I should\n          embrace another set of APIs on top of what has already been offered.\n          Every developer wants to be the rule maker instead of the follower\n          (including me of course). So sometimes we unnecessarily abstract\n          things and create learning overheads for other developers.\n        </p>\n        <p>I hate MicroSoft Office Suits and I am terriable at it.</p>\n        <p>\n          What I love about Computer Science is that it differs from other\n          natural sciences that it is the pure product of human decision-makings\n          and collaborations, from using 2 different signals to represent 0 and\n          1, to every subsequent decisons made. All the smart and stupid\n          decisions led us where we are now.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          I think machine is the least human thing ever, but the makings of it\n          is all about human, the humors, the compromises, etc, which I like a\n          lot.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          I believe Computer Science is the magic in our world (maybe there is\n          another world where alchemy is their magic, who knows).\n        </p>\n      </section>\n      <section class=\"projects\">\n        <h2>Some projects</h2>\n        <div>\n          <h3>\n            <a href=\"https://j.digimon.one\" target=\"_blank\">Journal app written with GraphQL + Apollo + React</a>\n          </h3>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <h3>\n            <a href=\"https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/delay-gratification/inldbhdeifiamplpaljaficncgpihlli\" target=\"_blank\">Chrome plugin that helps people spend less time on some sites</a>\n          </h3>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <h3>\n            placeholder for the links to the great open-source projects I will\n            be contributing to.\n          </h3>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <h3>\n            placeholder for the link to the React Native app that I have been\n            developing.\n          </h3>\n        </div>\n      </section>\n      <section class=\"contact-info\">\n        <h2>Contact</h2>\n        <div><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sumtsui/\">LinkedIn</a></div>\n        <div><a href=\"https://github.com/sumtsui\">GitHub</a></div>\n        <div style=\"user-select: all\">sumtsui@gmail.com</div>\n      </section>\n    </div>\n  </body>\n</html>\n"},"sourceMaps":null,"error":null,"hash":"c81bd67a98a1908eb57a7f6a4530b899","cacheData":{"env":{}}}
